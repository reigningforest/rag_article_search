Text: The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a COVID-19 was a global
pandemic in March 2020. It was initially started in china in the year 2019
December and affected an expanding number of nations in various countries in
the last few months. In this particular situation, many techniques, methods,
and AI-based classification algorithms are put in the spotlight in reacting to
fight against it and reduce the rate of such a global health crisis. COVID-19's
main signs are heavy temperature, different cough, cold, breathing shortness,
and a combination of loss of sense of smell and chest tightness. The digital
world is growing day by day, in this context digital stethoscope can read all
of these symptoms and diagnose respiratory disease. In this study, we majorly
focus on literature reviews of how SARS-CoV-2 is spreading and in-depth
analysis of the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease from human respiratory sounds
like cough, voice, and breath by analyzing the respiratory sound parameters. We
hope this review will provide an initiative for the clinical scientists and
researcher's community to initiate open access, scalable, and accessible work
in the collective battle against COVID-19.

Text: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused massive humanitarian and economic damage.
Teams of scientists from a broad range of disciplines have searched for methods
to help governments and communities combat the disease. One avenue from the
machine learning field which has been explored is the prospect of a digital
mass test which can detect COVID-19 from infected individuals' respiratory
sounds. We present a summary of the results from the INTERSPEECH 2021
Computational Paralinguistics Challenges: COVID-19 Cough, (CCS) and COVID-19
Speech, (CSS).

Text: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the health
and well-being of the global population. Apart from the global health crises,
the pandemic has also caused significant economic and financial difficulties
and socio-physiological implications. Effective screening, triage, treatment
planning, and prognostication of outcome plays a key role in controlling the
pandemic. Recent studies have highlighted the role of point-of-care ultrasound
imaging for COVID-19 screening and prognosis, particularly given that it is
non-invasive, globally available, and easy-to-sanitize. Motivated by these
attributes and the promise of artificial intelligence tools to aid clinicians,
we introduce COVIDx-US, an open-access benchmark dataset of COVID-19 related
ultrasound imaging data. The COVIDx-US dataset was curated from multiple
sources and its current version, i.e., v1.2., consists of 150 lung ultrasound
videos and 12,943 processed images of patients infected with COVID-19
infection, non-COVID-19 infection, other lung diseases/conditions, as well as
normal control cases. The COVIDx-US is the largest open-access fully-curated
dataset of its kind that has been systematically curated, processed, and
validated specifically for the purpose of building and evaluating artificial
intelligence algorithms and models.
