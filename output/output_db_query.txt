information-seeking behaviors among international students, with a focus on the
r/f1visa subreddit. Our study indicates a considerable rise in the number of

recurring questions demonstrate more active involvement in communication,
suggesting a continuous pursuit of knowledge. Furthermore, the thematic focus
has shifted from questions about jobs before COVID-19 to concerns about
finances, school preparations, and taxes during COVID-19. These findings carry

international students. To enhance international students' understanding and
navigation of this dynamic environment, future research in this field is
necessary.
